## 📂 RAW PEN LOGS (ARCHIVE 001 EXAMPLE)

> **ARCHIVE 001:** *The War of the Pen*  

**BACKGROUND:**  
The War of the Pen began as tensions escalated between several digital factions:
- NSCW (Neutral Socialist Commonwealth)
- Ink Co.
- USPR (United States of Pen Republic)

The initial cause was unknown—lost to the chaotic scroll of old group chats—but the consequences were immense. A once-stable order fractured, and alliances turned hostile.

**PHASE 1: THE RISE OF PEN**  
Agent Pen was a central figure—diplomatic, elusive, and relentless. Known for keeping order, Pen balanced chaos through treaties and coded documents. However, pressures mounted. Espionage, betrayal, and blackmail spiraled the GC into irreversible war.
